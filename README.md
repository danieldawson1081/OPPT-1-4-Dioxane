# OPPT-1-4-Dioxane
Files related to my work on the OPPT 1,4-Dioxane re-evaluation. 

These files include versions of water model EWISRD, R-scripts for processing information and interfacing with the model, and miscellaneous files helpful to the project. This information is being retained here in order to continue helping OPPT with the 1,4-dioxane re-evaluation as it pertains to the water pathway work I've been involved in.
